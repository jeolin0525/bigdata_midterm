bitcoin price prediction 101

This repo is to record the project prototype on the midterm 2018 spring.
Please feel free to download the code and sample datasets.
Just don't forget to give us a star!

Despite we didn't reach the goal for price prediction in this repo, it provides a good example to get the internal features (including daily # of transaction-in & out , daily # of bitcoin in transaction) using big query and merge the external features ( daily open, highest, lowest and closed price in USD) to fit on several well-known classification ML models.

We are are analizing the bitcoin price by minites with furthur time series analysis algorithm.
If you are interested in our research or get any good idea for related topics, please kindly leave your comment!
